# Twitter-Ecigarette-Conversations
A script using Python's NLTK, Gensim, and other features to analyze Twitter conversations related to e-cigarette use. 

# Motivation
I am currently working on a research project to understand the differences in the way the words "juul" versus "e-cigarette" are used when talking about vaping on Twitter. 

# Features
This script contains functions to find the frequencies of certain keywords, as well as the frequencies of words immediately preceding and following those keywords. There is also functionality that finds the surrounding context of certain keywords, as well as other words found in a similar context to the keyword. Currently I am working on implementing LDA using Gensim. 

# Installation 
This project currently uses Python 3. The NLTK and Gensim libraries can be installed using pip.
